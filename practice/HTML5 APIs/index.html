    <h1>HTML5 APIs</h1>
    <h2>HTML5</h2>
    <p>
      The W3C plans to develop future versions of HTML5 much more frequently
      than previously, using smaller version increments. HTML 5.1 has already
      become the latest standard, and HTML 5.2 is in development.
    </p>
    <h2>The data- Attribute</h2>
    <p>
      The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom
      attributes that are ignored by the browser.
    </p>
    <p>Their sole purpose is to be used by a JavaScript program.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with data-.</li>
      <li>
        Contain only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, dots, colons or
        underscores.
      </li>
      <li>Include an optional string value.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>data-powers = 'flight superSpeed'</p>
    <p>data-rating = '5'</p>
    <p>data-dropdown</p>
    <p>data-user = 'DAZ'</p>
    <p>data-max-length = '32'</p>
    <p>
      Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any
      dataattributes it contains. Example
    </p>
    <h2>HTML5 APIs</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML5 Web Storage</li>
      <p>
        The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer
      </p>
      <li>Geolocation</li>
      <p>
        The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the
        device.
      </p>
      <li>Web Workers</li>
      <p>
        Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support
        for concurrency in JavaScript
      </p>
      <li>Shared Web Workers</li>
      <p>
        You can also create shared web workers that allow lots of different
        scripts on the same domain to access the same worker object.
      </p>
      <li>Service Workers</li>
      <p>
        The Service Worker API allows a worker script to run in the background
        with the added benefit of being able to intercept network requests.
      </p>
      <li>Websockets</li>
      <p>
        Websocket is a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a
        server – also known as push messaging. This means that a connection is
        kept open and responses are ‘pushed’ to the client as soon as they are
        received.
      </p>
      <p>Example <a href="websocket.html">Websocket</a></p>
      <li>Notifications</li>
      <p>
        The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system’s
        notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the screen, but
        it changes depending on the operating system.
      </p>
      <li>Multimedia</li>
      <p>
        HTML5 introduced the audio and video tags used to insert audio and video
        clips into a web page. It also introduced a Media API for controlling
        the playback of the clips using JavaScript.
      </p>
      <li>Other APIs</li>
      <p>
        The list of APIs is constantly growing, and includes APIs for accessing
        a device’s camera, uploading files, accessing the battery status,
        handling push notifications, building drag-and-drop functionality,
        creating 3D effects with WebGL, and many more! A comprehensive list of
        HTML5 APIs can be found at the Mozilla Developer Network10.
      </p>
      <li>Drawing with Canvas</li>
      <p>
        The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a
        web page in real time using JavaScript. A canvas element is a
        rectangular element on the web page. It has a coordinate system that
        starts at (0,0) in the top-left corner.
      </p>
      <li>Shims and Polyfills</li>
      <p>
        The terms shim and polyfill are often used interchangeably. The main
        difference between them is that a shim is a piece of code that adds some
        missing functionality to a browser, although the implementation method
        may differ slightly from the standard API. A polyfill is a shim that
        achieves the same functionality, while also using the API commands that
        would be used if the feature was supported natively.
