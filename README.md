# WDD-330
## Description

This repository reflects the learning journey in a class designed with a unique approach. Instead of traditional lectures, I've learned to independently explore and solve problems using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The course emphasizes the importance of repetition and mentoring, allowing for deeper understanding through self-guided projects rather than group work. The focus is on building Single Page Web applications (SPAs) while sharpening problem-solving and debugging skills.

## Objectives

Develop SPAs using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Use curiosity and creativity to explore and solve coding problems.
Apply a "divide and conquer" strategy to break down complex problems.
Debug and troubleshoot both personal and peer code.
Strengthen technical skills through personal exploration projects.
